# RuleHawk Development TODO

This document tracks the development progress of RuleHawk, our lightweight CLI tool for enforcing codebase rules. It shows what's been implemented, what's in progress, and what remains to be built.

## ‚úÖ Implemented Features

These features have been fully implemented and are ready for use:

### Core Architecture

The foundational components that make RuleHawk work:

- [x] **Basic CLI structure** with Click framework
- [x] **Two-mode design** (check mode as default, fix mode with --fix)
- [x] **YAML default output** for agent parsing without context consumption
- [x] **Rule registry system** for managing all rules
- [x] **Configuration loader** supporting YAML format
- [x] **Basic rule runner** with exit code support
- [x] **AI bridge interface** supporting Claude, OpenAI, Cursor, Local
- [x] **Audit logging** in JSONL format
- [x] **ASCII owl logo** and consistent branding

### Commands

All core commands have been implemented with consistent options:

- [x] **`rulehawk check`** - Check all rules (YAML output, exits 1 on violations)
- [x] **`rulehawk init`** - Initialize rulehawk.yaml in current project
- [x] **`rulehawk explain`** - Show detailed information about specific rules
- [x] **`rulehawk report`** - Generate compliance reports
- [x] **`rulehawk preflight`** - Check preflight rules (alias for check --phase preflight)
- [x] **`rulehawk postflight`** - Check postflight rules (alias for check --phase postflight)
- [x] **`rulehawk inflight`** - Check inflight rules (alias for check --phase inflight)
- [x] **`rulehawk security`** - Check security rules (alias for check --phase security)

### Documentation Standards

Comprehensive documentation with enforced quality standards:

- [x] **Main README** explaining rules-first approach
- [x] **RuleHawk README** with clear two-mode design
- [x] **Command usage guide** clarifying no --check flag needed
- [x] **Simplified modes documentation** explaining check vs fix
- [x] **DOC-01 rule** enforcing no naked headings/lists
- [x] **DOC-02 rule** enforcing table documentation

### Configuration System

Complete configuration management:

- [x] **Master rulehawk.yaml** file structure defined
- [x] **Config file loading** from rulehawk.yaml or rulehawk.yaml
- [x] **Environment variable overrides** for flexibility
- [x] **Custom rules section** in configuration

## üöß Partially Implemented

These features are partially complete and need additional work:

### Rule Checking

Core checking functionality exists but needs real tool integration:

- [~] **Command-based checks** - Structure ready, needs actual tool installation
- [~] **AI-powered checks** - Structure ready, needs API keys for testing
- [~] **Auto-fix capability** - Fix mode implemented, needs tool integration

### Language Detection

Basic detection works but needs expansion:

- [~] **Basic language detection** - Python, JavaScript, TypeScript supported
- [ ] **Extended language support** - Go, Rust, Java, C++, etc. pending

## ‚ùå Not Yet Implemented

Critical features that need to be built for full functionality:

## üìã Architecture Decisions

Key architectural decisions that have been made:

### Rule Storage

We've decided on a single master configuration approach:

- **Decision:** Single `rulehawk.yaml` file (like `.eslintrc` or `.gitlab-ci.yml`)
- **Rationale:** Simpler than directory structures, easier to version control
- **Implementation:** Rules defined in YAML with clear structure

### Command Structure

We've simplified to a two-mode design:

- **Decision:** Check mode (default) and fix mode (--fix flag)
- **Rationale:** No need for separate enforce mode, check returns exit codes
- **Implementation:** Checking is implicit, no --check flag needed

### Output Format

YAML is the default output for agent compatibility:

- **Decision:** YAML default, with JSON and Markdown options
- **Rationale:** Agents can parse YAML without consuming context
- **Implementation:** Structured output with consistent schema

## üîß Immediate Actions for Dogfooding

To use RuleHawk on itself, these tasks are critical:

1. **Fix failing unit tests** - Update tests for two-mode design
2. **Implement YAML rule loader** - Read rules from rulehawk.yaml
3. **Fix package structure** - Make installation work properly
4. **Add graceful fallbacks** - Handle missing tools without crashing
5. **Update rulehawk init** - Generate proper default configuration

## üìÖ Development Roadmap

Our phased approach to building RuleHawk:

### Phase 1: Core Functionality ‚úÖ (Completed)
- **Two-mode CLI design** implemented
- **Basic rule structure** defined
- **Documentation standards** established
- **Command consistency** achieved

### Phase 2: Make It Usable (Current)
- **Fix test suite** to validate functionality
- **YAML rule loading** for configuration
- **Package installation** working properly
- **Tool fallbacks** for missing dependencies

### Phase 3: Production Ready
- **Comprehensive testing** with coverage
- **Performance optimization** for large codebases
- **Enhanced documentation** with examples
- **PyPI distribution** for easy installation

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
- **AI integration** with multiple providers
- **MCP support** for Claude
- **Analytics dashboard** for teams
- **Plugin ecosystem** for extensions

## üêõ Known Issues

Current bugs and limitations to address:

1. **Test Suite Failures** - Tests not updated for two-mode design
2. **Installation Issues** - Package structure prevents proper installation
3. **Missing Tool Handling** - No graceful fallback when tools aren't installed
4. **YAML Loading** - Rules still hardcoded instead of loaded from config
5. **Rule Context** - AI checks need better file context

## üìù Implementation Notes

Important considerations for development:

- **No --check flag** - This is by design, checking is default behavior
- **Exit codes matter** - 0 for success, 1 for violations (CI/CD compatibility)
- **YAML for agents** - Structured output agents can parse, not ingest
- **Documentation rules** - All docs must follow DOC-01 and DOC-02
- **Single config file** - One rulehawk.yaml, not complex directories

## üéØ Next Sprint Tasks

Priority tasks for immediate development:

1. **Fix unit tests** - Update all tests for two-mode design
2. **YAML rule loader** - Implement dynamic rule loading from config
3. **Package structure** - Fix imports and installation
4. **Tool fallbacks** - Add graceful handling for missing tools
5. **Update init command** - Generate complete default rulehawk.yaml
