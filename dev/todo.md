Now let's discuss automating enforcement! You can definitely create automated rule enforcement. Here are several approaches:

## 1. **Git Hooks + Rule Engine Script**

Create a `scripts/enforce-rules.py` that runs on:
- **Pre-commit:** Check formatting, file patterns, commit messages
- **Pre-push:** Run quick tests, coverage check
- **CI pipeline:** Full rule validation

```bash
# Example pre-commit hook
#!/bin/bash
python scripts/enforce-rules.py --stage=pre-commit
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "❌ Rule violations detected. Run 'python scripts/enforce-rules.py --fix' to auto-fix."
    exit 1
fi
```

## 2. **Claude-Powered Rule Checker**

You could create a script that calls Claude API to review code changes:

```python
# scripts/claude-reviewer.py
def check_with_claude(diff_content, rules_text):
    prompt = f"""
    Review this code diff against our coding rules:
    
    RULES:
    {rules_text}
    
    DIFF:
    {diff_content}
    
    Report any violations with specific line numbers and rule references.
    """
    # Call Claude API, parse response
```

## 3. **Multi-Tool Enforcement Pipeline**

Combine existing tools with custom checks:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/enforce-rules.yml
- name: R2 - Check artifacts
  run: |
    if find . -name "*.log" -o -name "debug_*" | grep -q .; then
      echo "❌ R2 violation: Debug artifacts found"
      exit 1
    fi

- name: R4 - Zero warnings  
  run: |
    python -m pytest -W error 2>&1 | tee pytest.log
    if grep -i warning pytest.log; then
      echo "❌ R4 violation: Warnings detected"
      exit 1
    fi
```

## 4. **Smart Rule Enforcement Agent**

Most sophisticated approach - create an agent that:
- Monitors PRs/commits
- Runs appropriate checks based on changed files
- Auto-fixes what it can (formatting, simple issues)
- Flags complex violations for human review
- Learns from patterns over time

```python
class RuleEnforcer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.claude_client = ClaudeClient()
        self.checks = [
            FilePatternCheck(),
            FormattingCheck(), 
            CoverageCheck(),
            SecurityCheck()
        ]
    
    def enforce_on_pr(self, pr_diff):
        violations = []
        for check in self.checks:
            if check.applies_to(pr_diff):
                result = check.run(pr_diff)
                if not result.passed:
                    violations.append(result)
        
        # For complex violations, ask Claude
        if self.needs_human_review(violations):
            claude_review = self.claude_client.review_violations(
                pr_diff, violations, self.rules
            )
            return claude_review
```

## 5. **Gradual Automation Strategy**

Start simple and evolve:

1. **Week 1:** Basic pre-commit hooks for formatting/linting
2. **Week 2:** Add file pattern detection and branch naming checks  
3. **Week 3:** Integrate coverage reporting and blocking
4. **Week 4:** Add Claude-powered PR review for complex rules
5. **Month 2:** Build learning system that suggests rule improvements

Would you like me to help you build any of these approaches? The Claude-powered reviewer could be particularly interesting since it could understand context and intent, not just pattern matching.
