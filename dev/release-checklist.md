- **Total lines**: ~4,750
- **Core components**: Working ✅

## ✅ What's Ready

### Core Functionality
- [x] Basic rule checking works
- [x] YAML/JSON/Markdown output formats

- [x] Command usage docs

### Testing
- [x] Unit tests (32/33 passing)
- [x] Self-testing (can check itself)
- [x] Manual testing confirmed working

## ⚠️ What Needs Work

### Critical for v0.1.0 Release
1. **Simplify structure** - Consider consolidating scattered files
2. **Remove experimental features** - MCP server (not ready)
3. **Fix hardcoded commands** - Some rules have hardcoded paths
4. **Package cleanup** - Remove dev artifacts

### Nice to Have (v0.2.0)
1. **More language support** - Go, Rust, Ruby
2. **Better fix automation** - Currently limited
3. **Plugin system** - Custom rule validators
4. **Web dashboard** - Visual rule compliance

## 🚦 Release Blockers

### HIGH Priority
1. **MCP dependency issue** - Comment out or make truly optional ✅
2. **Test coverage rule** - Hardcoded pytest path needs fixing
3. **Package structure** - Some imports might break in pip install

### MEDIUM Priority
1. **Enhanced runner** - Not integrated everywhere
2. **Rule registry** - Mix of hardcoded and YAML rules
3. **Documentation** - Needs consolidation

### LOW Priority
1. **Performance** - Some rules run slowly
2. **Error messages** - Could be clearer
3. **Windows support** - Not tested

## 📦 Recommended Actions for Release

### Immediate (for v0.1.0-alpha)
```bash
# 1. Clean up imports
find rulehawk -name "*.py" -exec grep -l "from mcp" {} \;
# Remove or make optional

# 2. Test pip install
pip install -e .
pip uninstall rulehawk
pip install .

# 3. Version bump
# Update pyproject.toml to 0.1.0-alpha

# 4. Create GitHub release
git tag v0.1.0-alpha
git push origin v0.1.0-alpha
```

### Before v0.1.0 Stable
1. **Consolidate code** - Merge similar modules
2. **Fix all hardcoded paths**
3. **Complete test coverage**
4. **User testing feedback**

## 📊 Complexity Assessment

The project has grown but is still manageable:

### Current Structure
```
rulehawk/
├── cli.py (400+ lines) - Main entry point
├── rules/
│   ├── registry.py - Rule definitions
│   ├── runner.py - Original runner
│   ├── enhanced_runner.py - New features
│   └── validators.py - Rule validation
├── detection/
│   ├── python_detector.py - Python projects
│   ├── javascript_detector.py - JS/TS projects
│   └── cpp_detector.py - C/C++ projects
├── config/
│   ├── loader.py - Config loading
│   └── yaml_loader.py - YAML rule loading
└── mcp/ (experimental - consider removing)
```

### Recommendations
1. **Merge runners** - Combine runner.py and enhanced_runner.py
2. **Simplify detection** - Maybe overkill for v0.1
3. **Remove MCP** - Not ready, adds complexity
4. **Focus on core** - Rule checking and reporting

## 🎯 Minimum Viable Release (v0.1.0-alpha)

Focus on core value: **A CLI tool that checks rules and gives clear feedback**

### Keep
- Rule checking with clear output
- YAML configuration
- Skip/exception support
- Multiple output formats

### Defer
- MCP server
- Complex project detection
- Auto-fixing (keep simple)
- AI integrations

## 📅 Suggested Timeline

1. **Today**: Remove/disable experimental features
2. **Tomorrow**: Test installation and basic workflows
3. **This Week**: Alpha release for feedback
4. **Next Week**: Fix issues from feedback
5. **Two Weeks**: v0.1.0 stable release

## Bottom Line

**Ready for alpha release** with minor cleanup. The core functionality works well. Main concerns are:
1. Some experimental features should be removed
2. Package structure needs validation
3. Documentation could be consolidated

The project is large but not unmanageable. Focus on shipping core features first, iterate based on user feedback.
